Description:   This package contains a daemon which can be used to forward
  PCP (Port Control Protocol - RFC6887) requests requests to PCP remote servers.

  In and of itself, it is not very useful, but combined with hnetd+miniupnpd
  it allows for control of NAT forwarding and firewall pinholes from multiple
  hops away.
